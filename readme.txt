For installation instructions refer to the FBE web page if you don't have an idea on how to use LaTeX.
Quick tip: As of 2016 www.sharelatex.com is a very easy way of importing the fbe_thesis_2016.zip file as a project and start writing your thesis in LaTeX.

Usage of LaTeX is highly recommended as it formats many of the thesis aspects without the need of consulting to the "format for theses" handbook included in FBE web page (Format.pdf).

For special cases some of which are:
Sideway figures/tables
Punctuation rules in equations, figures, tables
Page limitation on abstract/ozet pages
List of symbols formatting
In text bullet list / list numbering rules
Figures / Tables spanning 2+ pages
When to use CAPITAL LETTERS
Printer guidelines

you should consult the "format for theses" handbook (Format.pdf) and follow the rules listed in it.
