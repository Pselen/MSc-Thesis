\chapter{DATASET PREPARATION}
In this thesis, we predict the affinity score of drug-target pairs by using heterogeneous networks generated with the existing information of chemicals, proteins, and enriched with additional information extracted from the text representations of these biomolecules.

We compiled several databases in order to use different data types as inputs to our models to learn the distributional representation vectors of molecules. In this chapter we conduct a literature review about the databases, up-to-date statistical data, and the usage of the information.
