\section{STRING}
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, STRING \cite{szklarczyk2021string}, is a biological database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases.

The STRING database compiles information from several sources such as computational prediction methods, public text collections, laboratory experiments, and other databases. According to the statistics provided as of August 2021, the STRING database contains 67.592.464 proteins and 296.567.750 interactions at highest security (score $>=$ 0.900),  834.790.438 interactions with high security or better (score $>=$ 0.700), medium security or better 3.112.520.562 interactions (score $>=$ 0.400), and a total of 20,052,394,041 interactions.
