\section{Comparative Toxicogenomics Database}
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database \cite{davis2021comparative}, CTD, is a database that provides information on manually curated chemical–gene/protein interactions, chemical–disease and gene–disease relationships. CTD has several categories of data. These are chemicals, diseases, chemical-disease relationships, and gene-disease relationships. Statistical data as of February 2021 are given in Table \ref{tab:ctd_stats}. From these data, a total of 2.958.797 chemical-disease relationship and 28.253.189 gene-disease relationship data were compiled within the scope of the project.
