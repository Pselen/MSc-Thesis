\section{SIDER}

SIDER \cite{kuhn2010side, kuhn2016sider} is a database of drugs that have entered the market and their recorded adverse drug reactions extracted from public documents and prospectuses. Information such as side effect frequency, drug and side effect classification, and drug-target relationships are presented in a computer readable format. SIDER uses the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, which is a drug classification system that classifies the active substances of drugs according to the organ or system they act on and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. Side effects are coded by converting to MedDRA terminology. The current statistics of the data in the database are shown in Table \ref{tab:sider_stats}. From these data, 5,868 side effects and 139,756 drug-side effect relations were compiled within the scope of this thesis.
