\section{ChEMBL}
ChEMBL \cite{davies2015chembl, gaulton2017chembl} is a manually curated chemical database of molecules with drug-like properties and biological activity which is maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). The ChEMBL database contains bioactivity data of pharmaceutical active ingredients which are reported with Ki, Kd, IC50 and EC50 values. ChEMBL examines how small molecules interact with target proteins, and how these compounds affect cells and whole organisms. Moreover, ChEMBL includes information about the 2D structure, calculated molecular properties, and the ADMET properties, which are assessment of in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity of small molecules. According to the statistics as of May, 2020, there are 1.941.412 chemicals in the ChEMBL database.
