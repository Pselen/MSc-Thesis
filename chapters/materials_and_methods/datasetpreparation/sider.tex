\subsection{SIDER}
SIDER \cite{kuhn2010side, kuhn2016sider} is a database of drugs that have entered the market and their recorded adverse drug reactions extracted from public documents and prospectuses. Side effect frequency, drug classification, side effect classification, and drug-target relationships are presented in a computer-readable format. SIDER uses the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, a drug classification system that classifies the active substances of drugs according to the organ or system they act on and their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. The Medical Dictionary codes side effects for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology, a clinically validated medical terminology thesaurus. The statistics as of October 2015 are shown in Table \ref{tab:sider_stats}. We used 5,868 side effects and extracted 139,756 drug-side effect relations.
