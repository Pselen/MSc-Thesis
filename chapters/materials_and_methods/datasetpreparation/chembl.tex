\subsection{ChEMBL}
ChEMBL \cite{davies2015chembl, gaulton2017chembl} is a manually curated chemical database of molecules with drug-like properties and biological activity, which is maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). The ChEMBL database contains bioactivity data of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are reported with $K_i$, $K_d$, and IC50 values. ChEMBL examines how small molecules interact with target proteins and how these compounds affect cells and whole organisms. Moreover, ChEMBL includes information about the 2D structure, calculated molecular properties, and the ADMET properties such as in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of small molecules. As of May 2020, there are 1,941,412 chemicals in the ChEMBL database and we extract 10,935 drugs' 1D text representations, \textit{i.e.,} SMILES strings from ChEMBL. Using SMILES strings of drugs, we trained the CNN-based model that encodes each SMILES string character as numbers and the language-based model that leverages the similarity between drugs' SMILES strings.
