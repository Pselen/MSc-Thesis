\subsection{UniProt}
The Universal Protein Source (UniProt) \cite{uniprot2021uniprot} is an essential resource for available protein information, including protein sequence and functional information. According to current statistics, as of September 2021, the total number of sequence entries is 565,928. Using amino acid sequences of proteins, we trained the CNN-based model that encodes each amino acid sequence character as numbers and the language-based model that leverages the similarity between proteins' amino acid sequences.
