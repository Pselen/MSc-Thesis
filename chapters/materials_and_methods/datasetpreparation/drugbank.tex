\subsection{DrugBank}
DrugBank \cite{wishart2006drugbank, wishart2008drugbank, wishart2018drugbank} is an online database that contains drugs, drug-related data (chemical, pharmacological, and pharmaceutical), and target-related data (sequence, structure, and pathway) as both bioinformatics and cheminformatics sources. As of January 2021, DrugBank contains 14,350 drugs. In the scope of this thesis, we extract 2,682,158 drug-drug interaction information of 14,350 drugs. We create homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs and generate representations for ligands using drugs and the relation between drugs.
