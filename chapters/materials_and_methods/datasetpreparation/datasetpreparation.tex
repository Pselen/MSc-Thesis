\subsection{Databases}
\label{chapter:dataset_preparation}

This thesis predicts the affinity scores of drug-target pairs by using heterogeneous networks. To generate heterogeneous networks, we combine the existing biomolecule data with the information extracted from text representations of biomolecules.

We compiled several databases to use as inputs to our models to learn the distributed representation vectors of molecules. This chapter conducts a literature review of the databases and up-to-date statistical data.



% First a couple of databases need a re-write to clarify their use. It would be nice if you add a couple of sentences to each one on their "importance" for the task. If there are databases you dont use directly or indirectly, just drop them.
