\subsection{Comparative Toxicogenomics Database}
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database \cite{davis2021comparative} (CTD), is a database that provides information on manually curated chemicalâ€“gene$/$protein interactions, chemical-disease, and gene-disease relationships. CTD has several categories of data. These are chemicals, diseases, chemical-disease relationships, and gene-disease relationships. 

\input{chapters/materials_and_methods/datasetpreparation/tables/ctd}

Table \ref{tab:ctd_stats} shows the available number of chemicals, diseases, and the association between diseases and chemicals$/$genes, as of February 2021. Since some diseases are common for both chemicals and genes, we extracted 2,958,797 chemical-disease relationships and 28,253,189 gene-disease relationships within the scope of this thesis in order to generate heterogeneous graphs.
